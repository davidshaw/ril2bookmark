ril2bookmark
============

Converts a Pocket (formerly Read It Later) list export file to standard bookmark format.

Usage is simple. Make sure your file is executable (`chmod +x ril2bookmark.sh`) then simple run the following command:

`./ril2bookmark.sh (RIL export.html)`

This will output to stdout. If you'd like to save the result to a file, it's as easy as:

`./ril2bookmark.sh (RIL export.html) > bookmarks.html`

Enjoy your newfound freedom!
